## Assignment 1: 

### Full-Stack Development 

- Full-stack web development involves working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications.

    - **Front-End Development**:

        - Involves creating the visual elements of the application that users interact with.
        - Uses technologies like **HTML** for content structure, **CSS** for design and layout, and **JavaScript** for interactivity.
        - Front-end frameworks, such as React or Angular, help build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

    - **Back-End Development**:

        - Focuses on the server, database, and application logic that powers the application.
        - It involves writing the code that processes requests, stores data, and ensures the application runs as intended.
        - **Node.js** is commonly used for server-side development, which provides a JavaScript runtime environment that allows for fast execution and scalability.
        - Other technologies include:
             - **MongoDB** and **MySQL** as database management systems.
            - **APIs** enable communication between the front-end and back-end, providing data dynamically.

- A **Full-Stack Developer** have the capability to work on all aspects of a web project, making them versatile and valuable team members who ensure efficient project completion and holistic problem-solving.

### Node.js

- Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. 
- This allows for seamless integration of front-end and back-end development, as developers can use JavaScript across both layers. 
- Node.js is known for its non-blocking I/O model, which allows handling multiple requests without waiting for previous tasks to complete. 
- Itâ€™s particularly useful for building real-time, scalable applications.
- Node.js is supported by NPM (Node Package Manager), which offers a wide range of libraries to enhance the functionality of web applications.

### Version Control, Git and GitHub

1. **Version Control** is a system that helps manage and track changes to code over time. It enables multiple developers to collaborate efficiently, and helps developers keep track of their work, make changes without fear of losing previous versions, and collaborate smoothly.

2. **Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to manage and track their code locally, while also enabling them to synchronize their work with others through a central repository, such as GitHub.

    - **Git Commit**:
        - The `git commit` command is used to save changes to the local repository. Each commit includes a message that explains the changes made.
        - The commit message should be concise (72 characters or fewer) for the subject line and optionally include a longer description.
    - **Git Push** 
        - This command sends your committed changes to the GitHub repository, syncing your local changes with the cloud.

    - **Git Pull**
        - This fetches any changes made by others and merges them with your local code.
   

3. **GitHub** a cloud-based platform, further enables collaboration by hosting Git repositories, providing access control, and allowing for the sharing of code and issues. 

    - These tools ensure that multiple developers can contribute efficiently and keep track of changes in the development process, improving overall project management.

### Markdown & Documentation

- **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text, often used in readme files, documentation, and blogs.

- It ensures that documents are human-readable and can be formatted quickly, making it ideal for writing technical documentation and creating content that is easy to understand.

- **Markdown Syntax Example**:

    - **Bold** and _Italic_:
        - Bold: `**Bold text**`
        - Italic: `_Italic text_`
